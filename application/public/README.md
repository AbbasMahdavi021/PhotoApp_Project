## Purpose of Repository

This repository will be used to the source code for all three assignments. You will be expected for each assignment to:

All HTML files should be in the html folder and ALL CSS files should be stored in the css folder. Failure to put files in the correct folders will cause points to be deducted from your assignment score.

1. Create a new branch for each new assignment. The name of the branch will be chosen by you but should be related to the assignment.
2. Complete all the requirements for each assignment.
3. Push all completed code to the branch.
4. Merge completed code back into the master branch.

This is something you will be doing for every assignment.
