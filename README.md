# PhotoApp

## Purpose

Welcome to PhotoApp, a web application built with JavaScript and MySQL for the backend, and .hbs templates for the frontend. This project was one of the first web apps I developed, and while it may not have the same level of professionalism as my later works, it holds a special place in my heart. Through PhotoApp, I aimed to gain experience in working with databases, creating web applications, and connecting them with a backend database.

## Features

User Authentication: Users can create an account, log in, and log out securely. All routes are protected using route middlewares to ensure that only authenticated users can access them.

Image Posts: Users can add image posts to the platform, sharing their favorite photos with others.

Comments: Users can add comments on their own posts as well as on posts created by other users. They can view comments associated with each post, fostering interaction and engagement within the community.

Post Search: Users have the ability to search for posts based on specific criteria, allowing them to discover posts of interest more easily.

## Technologies Used

JavaScript: The project is primarily built using JavaScript, which powers both the backend and the frontend functionalities.

MySQL: The backend of the application utilizes MySQL as the database management system to store and retrieve data related to users, posts, and comments.

.hbs Templates: The frontend of the application is rendered using .hbs (Handlebars) templates, allowing for dynamic rendering of data received from the backend.
